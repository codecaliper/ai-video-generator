Remote working is a type of working arrangement where employees are not required to be physically present in an office. Instead, they can work from home or any other location outside of the office. This is often done through the use of technology such as video conferencing, remote desktop access, cloud-based software, and communication tools. Remote working can provide employees with greater flexibility, improved work-life balance, and cost savings for the company.
